BOSSMAN CHECKLIST · NorthStar Engines
=====================================

Owner: Jay / The Captain / Bossman
Scope: This repo (NorthStar Engines: audio, video, 3D, analytics)

Purpose:
- This is MY ritual, not the agents’.
- When I open this repo, I run through this once.
- It keeps me and the agents (Gem, Max, Claude, Ossie) aligned.

A. DAILY OPEN-REPO RITUAL
-------------------------

1. Ground in the Rules
   - Open:
     - docs/constitution/00_CONSTITUTION.md
     - docs/constitution/01_FACTORY_RULES.md
   - If anything in the repo feels off vs these, fix docs or plans before new work.

2. Find the Map
   - Open docs/MANIFESTO.md
   - Check it still points to:
     - README.md
     - requirements.txt
     - docs/constitution/*
     - docs/20_ENGINES_PLAN.md
     - docs/99_DEV_LOG.md
     - docs/logs/ENGINES_LOG.md

3. Check the Logs
   - Open docs/99_DEV_LOG.md (repo-wide) and docs/logs/ENGINES_LOG.md (per-engine).
   - If I just did work and didn’t log it, add an entry before starting new stuff.

4. Confirm the Active Task
   - Open docs/20_ENGINES_PLAN.md
   - Find:
     - Current Active Engine Task ID (e.g. E-03)
     - Current phase for that task.
   - Say out loud:
     - “Today I’m working on: <TASK_ID> – <short description>.”

5. Bring Agents Back Online (in my head)
   - Gem = Architect / Planner (plans only).
   - Max = Implementer / Worker (code, wiring, concrete docs).
   - Claude = Team Blue / QA (checks work vs plan and rules).
   - Ossie = Styling / OSS helper.
   - Control Tower ChatGPT = strategic planning chat, NOT repo-connected.

6. Choose ONE Phase
   - From the Active Task, pick a single phase.
   - Note it somewhere:
     - “FOCUS: <TASK_ID> / <PHASE>”
   - Don’t spawn new tasks in my head until this phase is done and logged.

7. End-of-Session Ritual
   - Before closing:
     - Plan file updated? (phase marked Done; task moved if fully complete)
     - docs/logs/ENGINES_LOG.md updated?
     - docs/99_DEV_LOG.md updated for any big decisions?
     - If QA needed, prepare a short “QA this task” note for Claude next time.

B. ROLE CHEAT-SHEET
-------------------

1. Gem (Architect / Planner)
   - Owns plans and structure.
   - Writes and maintains docs like:
     - docs/20_ENGINES_PLAN.md
     - Any engine-specific plan docs we add later.
   - Breaks work into phases with:
     - Steps (Max / Implementer)
     - Logging & Status (Max)
   - Never writes production code.

2. Max (Implementer / Worker)
   - Reads Constitution, Factory Rules, Roles & Models, BOSSMAN.txt.
   - Reads the Active Task section in docs/20_ENGINES_PLAN.md.
   - Implements code according to the plan.
   - For each completed phase:
     - Updates docs/logs/ENGINES_LOG.md
     - Marks the phase Done in the plan.
   - When a task is fully complete:
     - Moves the task from Active → Completed in docs/20_ENGINES_PLAN.md.

3. Claude (Team Blue / QA)
   - Reads Constitution, Factory Rules, Roles & Models, plans, logs.
   - Checks implementation vs plan vs rules.
   - Adds QA stamp under each completed task:
     - QA: Claude – PASS (YYYY-MM-DD – short notes)
     - or
     - QA: Claude – FAIL (reason, required fixes)

4. Ossie (Styling / OSS)
   - Helps with styling, mechanical refactors, small engine utilities.
   - Follows plans; does not change governance or business logic.

5. Control Tower ChatGPT (this style of chat)
   - Helps me think and design.
   - Helps me write prompts for Gem, Max, Claude, Ossie.
   - Keeps everything aligned with this BOSSMAN.txt and the Constitution.

C. IF I FEEL LOST
-----------------

1. Stop.
2. Re-open BOSSMAN.txt.
3. Re-run the 7-step ritual quickly.
4. Spin up a Control Tower chat and paste the current Active Task section from docs/20_ENGINES_PLAN.md.
