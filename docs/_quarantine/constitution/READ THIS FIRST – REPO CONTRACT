Alright, here’s something you can straight copy-paste into the doc.
I’ll keep it tight and in your structure.

NORTHSTAR OS – REPO + BUILD CONTRACT

1. Repos (DO NOT FREESTYLE)

We use four repos. Every agent and dev stays in their lane:
	•	northstar-core
	•	All websites + apps (SQUARED, CUBED, etc.).
	•	UltreX (the builder) lives here under SQUARED.
	•	Agent runtime, registries, cards, and API surface also live here.
	•	northstar-ui
	•	Library of basic UI elements / atoms / layouts used by all apps.
	•	Optional early versions of UltreX components can live here, but not the live UltreX app.
	•	northstar-engines
	•	All engines and rules that underpin the OS (UI layout engines, marketing engines, scoring, etc.).
	•	No routing, no pages – just brains.
	•	northstar-connectors
	•	All external connectors: Shopify, YouTube, Twitter, Google Ads, etc.
	•	Used by engines, not directly by the front end.

2. northstar-core – ROUTING SPINE (APPS + PAGES)

This is the canonical tree for the live site + apps:

northstar-core/
  squared/                            # /squared/...
    index.html                        # /squared

    caidence/                         # /squared/caidence/...
      app/
        index.html                    # /squared/caidence/app/
      agent-marketing-for-social.html # /squared/caidence/agent-marketing-for-social.html

    ultrex/                           # UltreX (builder) lives ON SQUARED
      app/
        index.html                    # /squared/ultrex/app/

  cubed/                              # /cubed/...
    index.html                        # /cubed
    creaite/                          # /cubed/creaite/...
      app/
        index.html                    # /cubed/creaite/app/

  runtime/                            # agent runtimes actually used in PROD
    adk/
    langgraph/

  registry/                           # registries + cards
    agents/
    flows/
    ui_atoms/
    surfaces/

  config/
    env/
    routes/

	•	UltreX URL: /squared/ultrex/app/
	•	All user-facing marketing + app routes live under northstar-core in this shape.
	•	Registry + runtime are also here so core stays the “single source of truth”.

3. northstar-ui – UI LIBRARY ONLY

northstar-ui/
  atoms/
    buttons/
    cards/
    tables/
    headers/
    ...
  layouts/
    marketing_sections/
    dashboards/
    auth_flows/
  ultrex-proto/        # optional: prototype components for the builder

	•	This repo does not contain live pages.
	•	Apps in northstar-core (including UltreX) import atoms/layouts from here.
	•	UI-only agents work here so they can’t accidentally trash core routes.

⸻

4. northstar-engines – OS BRAINS

northstar-engines/
  ui_layout/
  marketing/
  social/
  scoring/
  ...

	•	All core logic and engines live here.
	•	northstar-core/runtime calls into these engines.
	•	No HTML, no routing.

⸻

5. northstar-connectors – EXTERNAL PIPES

northstar-connectors/
  shopify/
  youtube/
  twitter/
  google-ads/
  ...

	•	One folder per external system.
	•	Engines in northstar-engines use these; northstar-core only sees them through engines.

⸻

6. BUILD & DEPLOY (IN HUMAN TERMS)
	•	You edit code and files inside these repos (mainly northstar-core and northstar-ui).
	•	A build step (e.g. npm run build) just means:
“Take my dev files, bundle/minify them, and spit out a clean folder that can be served.”
	•	For northstar-core:
	•	The build turns your squared/, cubed/, etc. into a deployable bundle.
	•	That bundle goes into a container (Docker) and is run on Cloud Run (or similar).
	•	The folder structure above (squared/caidence/app etc.) is the logical routing, even if the built assets are packed up.
	•	For northstar-ui:
	•	The build produces a library/package of atoms/layouts.
	•	northstar-core and UltreX then import from that built library rather than raw source.

You don’t need to care about the low-level Docker stuff – just remember:

Repos are where you edit.
Builds are what we deploy.
The routing spine in northstar-core is the thing nobody fucks with.
