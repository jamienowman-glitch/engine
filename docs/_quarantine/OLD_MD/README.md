# NorthStar Engines

Shared engines for audio, video, 3D, and analytics.

This repo focuses on the *engines themselves*:
- Audio engines (ASR, TTS, music, mixing).
- Video engines (cutting, captioning, overlays).
- 3D engines (layout, scenes, render pipelines).
- Analytics engines (metrics, dashboards, scoring).

Everything here is governed by:
- docs/constitution/00_CONSTITUTION.md
- docs/constitution/01_FACTORY_RULES.md
- docs/constitution/02_ROLES_AND_MODELS.md
- docs/MANIFESTO.md
- docs/99_DEV_LOG.md
