# 88mph Workflow Lane
- This lane is the only writable plan surface for 88mph Maybes + hardening work; everything else is reference-only unless a phase explicitly cites it.
- Use the phases in 00_MASTER_PLAN.md; do not improvise outside them.
- Engines remain deterministic; no prompts/agent logic/behavior changes are allowed in engines. Strategy Lock, Firearms, Auth, KPI/Temperature semantics, and 3D/video/audio engines are hands-off unless a phase explicitly says otherwise.
