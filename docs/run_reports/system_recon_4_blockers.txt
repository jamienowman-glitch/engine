SYSTEM RECON · BLOCKERS (ranked)

1) Real transports and Nexus persistence absent
- Chat HTTP/WS/SSE services are in-memory stubs with echo replies (engines/chat/service/*). No state store, Nexus integration, or agent calls. Production launch blocked until real transports, auth, and persistence are implemented.

2) Guardrails/PII/logging engines are stubs
- Strategy Lock and 3-Wise guardrails return stub data (engines/guardrails/strategy_lock, three_wise).
- PII text strip engine is a no-op stub (engines/guardrails/pii_text).
- Logging engine is stubbed (engines/logging/events/engine.py). Launch requires real enforcement, policy, and sinks.

3) Temperature/KPI control is stubbed
- Temperature engine always returns neutral band (engines/control/temperature/engine.py); KPI/Budget corridors are schemas only. Cannot gate behaviours or trigger alerts.

4) Media/audio pipeline largely placeholder
- ASR (AUDIO.ASR.WHISPER_V1) is a stub; beat features/segmenters exist but many steps depend on ffmpeg/librosa/torch not installed. No dataset packing outputs present.

5) Training/LoRA paths are metadata stubs
- TRAIN.LORA.LOCAL_V1 and TRAIN.LORA.PEFT_HF_V1 only emit stub metadata when torch unavailable; no real fine-tuning.

6) No infra adapters
- No Firestore Nexus adapter, no GCS upload/download helpers, no Secret Manager loaders. Deployment to Cloud Run/Vertex/Firestore buckets remains doc-only.

7) Placeholder cards only
- Only placeholder app/federation cards exist (docs/cards/plan-023/*); no real surface/app registry wiring in code. Behavioural routing via agents is absent.

8) Tests/tooling gaps
- pytest not available in env; many engines unvalidated in current run. ML deps missing (librosa/torch/faster-whisper/transformers).
